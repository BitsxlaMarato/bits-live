# How to develop

> To be able to install this project is necessary to run it in a node specific version. So for that you need to have installed Node.js

## Install and run the project

### Install the correct version of Node and install it

1. Have NVM installed in you system, if you don't have it, [install it](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md)
2. Install the expected version in nvm we will use:
    ```sh
   nvm install 12.22.12
   ```
3. Change the current version to the one that we just installed:
    ```sh
   nvm use 12.22.12
   ```

### Clone the project

```sh
git clone https://github.com/BitsxlaMarato/bits-live.git
cd bits-live
```

### Install the dependencies of project

   ```sh
    npm install
   ```

_If you are having any problem when installing dependencies, check the Troubleshooting guide_

### Run the project

Use `npm run serve` to compile and serve the dist directory in real time. Then view the website at [https://localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080)

```sh
npm run serve
```
All the changes will be reflected real time, in the browser.

## Edit content

### Change theme

If you want to change the theme you should change some properties
1. For changing the background image: Go to `public/assets/live/bg.jpg` and replace it with the one you want (with the same name).
2. For changing all the colors: Go to `src/live/params.scss` and in the top of the file you will find all the colors.

### Update basic information

The screens you will need to change for sure, are the following ones:

#### Home page (Inici)

#### Donations (Donatius)

#### Challenges (Reptes)

#### Activities (Activitats)

#### Schedule (Horari)

To update or change the schedule go to `public/data/schedule.json`. And you will need to do the following changes:
1. Change the start of the hackathon, this is the property `countdownStart`, the specified hour should be the start of the codding time and not the start where the events start. This will trigger the countdown to start working.
2. Add all the events in the property `days`. Each day have the following properties:
   ```json
   {
      "name": "Day of the week, example: Divendres",
      "date": "DD/MM/YYYY, example: 16/12/2023",
      "events": []
   }
   ```
   
   Each day will have events, as many as we want, inside the array of `events`. This should have the following properties:
   ```json
   {
      "id": "0",
      "title": "Registre",
      "startHour": "17:00",
      "endHour": "18:00",
      "localization": "Entrada de la sala d'actes de l'edifici Vèrtex",
      "description": "Short description"
   }
   ```
   **Note**: The `id` should be increasing in each event, 

The duration of it must be changed in `src/config.js`, and it's set in hours.

#### Schedule file

- `id` can be whatever you want, but all ids must be different
- When writing hours, prepend zeroes: Nice: 01:00; Not-so-nice: 1:00.
- Events should be ordered by starting hour
- `baseTimeOffset` should be the same output as executing (new Date()).getTimezoneOffset() in a machine with local time. (UTC - localtime in minutes)
- `dates` are DD/MM/YYYY format

> If an event doesn't have endHour, then will show only startHour and it will finish at the same time as it starts.  
Useful to specify events that don't have concept of length or that span through more than one day ("Event start", "Event end")

## Site Sections

All the sections this live page includes:

### Config

Some parameters (offsets, timeouts, defaults) can be changed in `src/config.js`. Keep in mind that some values are just constants and should not be changed.
Here you can edit the `FAKE_DATE` parameter to test funtionalities.

## Deploy

### Deploy to localhost

Use `npm run build` to compile all dist directory. The files will be compiled to `/dist/`.

Use `serve -s dist` to just serve `/dist` at [https://localhost:5000](https://localhost:5000).

```sh
npm run build
serve -s dist
```

### Deploy to production

**Push to master**. [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/sites/bits-live-2020) will build and deploy automatically.

If you push something that doesn't build, don't worry, it won't be published.
